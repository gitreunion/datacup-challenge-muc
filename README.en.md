Our team has chosen to respond to the Conversational Agent challenge for Kap Numérik led by the Réunion Region. This challenge is part of a crucial digital transformation context for small businesses. The Kap Numérik initiative aims to support them through the creation of a conversational agent. Its goal is to simplify access to information and optimize assistance, thus meeting the growing needs for responsiveness and accessibility.
